# useR! 2020 online tutorial on mlr3

The tutorial will be held by [Bernd Bischl](https://twitter.com/BBischl) and [Michel Lang](https://twitter.com/michellangts) on (date TBA).
The event is hosted by the [RLadies Gal√°pagos](https://twitter.com/rladiesgps).

## About

Our tutorial introduces the package [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) for modern, state-of-the-art machine learning in R.
The `mlr3` ecosystem provides a one-stop solution for all machine learning (ML) needs, spanning preprocessing, model learning and evaluation, ensembles, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning. 
Its pipeline system [mlr3pipelines](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) allows to easily express complex workflows, and to quickly prototype new ideas and applications. 
Whether you are applying ML to solve a practical prediction problem, implementing learning algorithms as a research software engineer or researching ML by empirical means, 
`mlr3` can help make your workflow more readable and efficient.


## Learning Objectives

The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce and familiarize users with `mlr3` and its ecosystem. 
This will allow participants to take advantage of its functionality for their own projects, in particular:

* how to benchmark and compare different machine learning approaches in a statistically sound manner,
* how to build complex machine learning workflows, including preprocessing and stacked ensembles,
* automatic hyperparameter tuning and pipeline optimization (AutoML),
* how to get the technical "nitty-gritties" for ML experiments right, e.g., speed up by parallelization, encapsulation of experiments in external processes or working on databases.


After the tutorial, participants will be able to implement complex solutions to real-world machine learning problems, and to evaluate the different design decisions necessary for such implementations, in particular the choice between different modelling and preprocessing techniques.


## Target Audience
We target to users with at least basic knowledge of machine learning concepts who are not yet familiar with `mlr3`. 
We require a working knowledge of R at medium level. 
Being able to work with tabular data is essential (subsetting, summarizing, transforming) and one should know R's general type system and basic operations.
