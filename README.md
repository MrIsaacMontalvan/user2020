# useR! 2020 online tutorial on mlr3

The tutorial will be held by [Bernd Bischl](https://twitter.com/BBischl) and [Michel Lang](https://twitter.com/michellangts) on (date TBA).
The event is hosted by the [RLadies Gal√°pagos](https://twitter.com/rladiesgps).


## About

Our tutorial introduces the package [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) for modern, state-of-the-art machine learning in R.
The `mlr3` ecosystem provides a one-stop solution for all machine learning (ML) needs, spanning preprocessing, model learning and evaluation, ensembles, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning. 
Its pipeline system [mlr3pipelines](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) allows to easily express complex workflows, and to quickly prototype new ideas and applications. 
Whether you are applying ML to solve a practical prediction problem, implementing learning algorithms as a research software engineer or researching ML by empirical means, 
`mlr3` can help make your workflow more readable and efficient.


## Learning Objectives

The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce and familiarize users with `mlr3` and its ecosystem. 
This will allow participants to take advantage of its functionality for their own projects, in particular:

* how to benchmark and compare different machine learning approaches in a statistically sound manner,
* how to build complex machine learning workflows, including preprocessing and stacked ensembles,
* automatic hyperparameter tuning and pipeline optimization (AutoML),
* how to get the technical "nitty-gritties" for ML experiments right, e.g., speed up by parallelization, encapsulation of experiments in external processes or working on databases.


## Target Audience

We target to users with at least basic knowledge of machine learning concepts who are not yet familiar with `mlr3`. 
We require a working knowledge of R at medium level.
One should know R's general type system and basic operations.
For the exercises (which we will not do live anymore due to the transition to an online course), it is also essential to work with tabular data (subsetting, summarizing, transforming).


## Course Materials 

We will publish slides and example code in time before the tutorial starts in this GitHub repository.
We also highly recommend to check out our [book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/), [cheat sheets](https://cheatsheets.mlr-org.com/), and the [gallery](https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com/) with exemplary case studies
